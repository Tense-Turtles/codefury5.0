# Problem statement

StartUps are booming more than ever. The need for innovation, solution are and will always be on the rise. But the issue is startups aren't growing due to lack of funding, guidance and support. So we present our Solution.

# Solution

A website that tends to focus on solving the major problem "Why most of the newbie startups fail to grow successfully in long terms", the application provides startups a portal through which they can connect to a mentor/mentors for specific problems faced by them among different domains. Eventually, the startups have to pay mentors for guidance with a minimal fee establishing mutualism among the startup and the mentor.

The application even tends to provide a community section that provides peers/students with similar views/ideas to connect and work together and over different startups. And a startup homepage, where the startup group can post updates on the progress of its work, can also link their social media posts, and finally, a feed system that provides all the latest updates about the startups, a list of renowned investors, mentors.

The above implementations were from the startup side, well as an investor we provide a feed through which investors can parse through the startups among interested domains and fund their favorite ideas.

# Prompts implemented:
- Developed a chat room for the startup group to interact with the mentor
- Developed desktop Push notifications after the user grants permissions
- Added SEO to our application to improve the visibility of the site
